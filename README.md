This is my coursework for Web Development module in Westminster University in Tashkent. 

I made a website for Burger King - a fast food restaurant.
The website is very simple and easy to use. It has 3 different pages. The first page is the home page. The second page is sign-up page and the third page is a log-in page. I tried to make the layout of the pages different from each other.
I am going to deploy it using netlify.app and github.
